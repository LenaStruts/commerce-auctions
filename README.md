# commerce-auctions
In this project I worked on creating an auction website using Django framework. On the main page there are active listings cards with some information like title, price and date published. To get more information about particular listing you can go to the listing page. There, it is possible to bid on the listing, see the history of bids, add a comment and view previous comments and add or remove an item to the watchlist. On the watchlist page you can look at your favorite listings and see if your bid won. In the app navigation there is an option for creating new listings, which will be shown at the active listings page. In addition, if you are looking for an item in particular category you can visit category page to see the listings categorized. To add some styles to my page I used Font Awesome glyphicons and Bootstrap framework. In particular navigation bar, listing cards and list of categories are Bootstrap components I used. The auction app is deployed at Heroku using itâ€™s Postgres database.
